The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction.Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 uM.

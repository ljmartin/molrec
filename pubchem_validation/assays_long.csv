The reaction is carried out in flat-bottom, 96-well, or 384-well microplates. After the substrate was deacetylated by HDACs, the product AMC which was obtained from hydrolysis by trypsin can generate fluorescence signal. Measurement is taken in using an multilabe plate reader a 355 nm excitation filter and a 460 nm emission filter. The initial rate of fluorescence should accurately reflect the rate of product formation and enzyme activity. Sample processing: The sample was dissolved in DMSO and kept at a low temperature. DMSO in the final system is limited under a low concentration which won't affect the enzyme activity."

In summary, a peptide is designed that is cleaved by the protease. The peptide is labelled with dabcyl at the N terminus and Lucifer Yellow at the C-terminus, such that for an intact peptide the Lucifer Yellow fluorescence is quenched by the dabcyl. When the peptide is cut by BACE2, the quenching is removed and a fluorescent signal is generated. The assay was performed as described in Grueninger et al. 2002 at pH 4.5 using a substrate concentration of 5  inverted question markM. A FRET peptide based on the TMEM27 sequence was devised. dabcyl-QTLEFLKIPS-LucY (SEQ ID NO: 1). BACE2 had a high activity against this sequence, which is unrelated to the known APP-based substrates.
